# Image Processing (ROBT 310): Homework Project 2
Matlab version R2020a
## Description
The homework project 2 consists of two parts: 
1) warm up part and
 Warm-up part:
 1.1 Implement Nearest-Neighbor Interpolation technique for a gray-scale image
 1.2 Histogram equalization 
2) main part:
 Visual illusion
 Floyd–Steinberg dithering:
 “Dither is an intentionally applied form of noise used to randomize quantization error, preventing largescale patterns such as color banding in images.”

# The warm-up part 
# 1.1 Nearest-Neighbor Interpolation technique
1.1) A grayscale image was taken and enlarged using Nearest-Neighbor Interpolation technique.
